This repository contains all the exercises completed for imperative programming in the Programming Paradigms course. Please refer to the provided PDF and review the exercises.

It also includes the code developed in class for Haskell, which represents functional programming. The Prolog exercises are not included, as most of them were completed using an online platform.

For object-oriented programming, you can find the related code in the "Paradi_Progra_Game-Smaltalk-CSharp" folder, where we applied the principles of object-oriented design.
